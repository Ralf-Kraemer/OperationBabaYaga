## Operation Baba Yaga  

### Background  

Since the war criminal and dictator Vladimir Putin has thrown a deadly shadow onto the free, brave and beautiful country of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government and its people have asked the world for help, and the world has begun to answer the call. This includes the Anonymous collective.

As a past and present Anonymous supporter and activist, I felt like finding ways to help.

Whilst hardly anything is ever truly official, when it comes to informal yet global collectives, I do not claim any direct association or involvement of Anonymous in Operation Baba Yaga.
We are Legion, though, and you should have expected us.

русский корабль, иди нахуй! Слава Україні!


### What it is and does  

1. Baba Yaga generates likely-to-exist Russian email addresses, by combining some of the most common (or most important) personal names, family names and email address domains in Russia.

2. Baba Yaga then "curses" each email address, without verifying its existence, by randomly signing it up to a European or Ukrainian newsletter, with news coverage of Putin's illegal and appalling invasion of Ukraine.

3. Operation Baba Yaga is a humble and somewhat desperate attempt to pierce the veil of deception and censorship, that the ONF and their grunts are trying to create in and around Russia.

4. The goal of Operation Baba Yaga is to widen the availability of critical and less biased information, particularly about Russian war crimes in Ukraine, and to support progressive, pacifist and democratic sentiments in Russia.

5. Due to the randomness of everything Baba Yaga does, including randomized delays inbetween sending requests to servers, the chance of harmfully flooding servers is near zero.


### What it isn't and doesn't  

1. Operation Baba Yaga is not an attack.

2. Baba Yaga is not a bot, and not a DDoS software.

3. Baba Yaga does not cause any damage to living creatures or physical objects.

4. Ukraine is NOT the target or enemy of Baba Yaga.

5. The peaceful and Putin-averse people among the people of Russia are NOT the target or enemy of Baba Yaga.

6. Baba Yaga does not target children. It also does not discriminate.

7. Baba Yaga does not steal data, or hold any email addresses that are known to exist, hence does not specifically violate anyone's right to privacy.
